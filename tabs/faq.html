      <summary>Why should I get a tune?</summary>
      <p style="margin-left: 0px; padding-left: 15px; list-style-type: disc;">
        We love our Toyota and Lexus; however, the factory logic falls short of expectations. 
        The inadequate throttle response, persistent gear hunting, lack of power and unsatisfactory fuel efficiency all point to
        one thing - it's time for a tune.

    <details>
      <summary>How do I set up an appointment?</summary>
      <p style="margin-left: 0px; padding-left: 15px; list-style-type: disc;">
        We schedule services by appointment only. To secure your appointment, a $100 deposit is required 
        when a date is confirmed, which will be applied toward the total cost of the tune. <br><br>
        For instance, if the tuning service costs $500, the initial $100 deposit will be deducted, leaving a balance of $400 to be settled at the time of the appointment.

      <p style="margin-left: 0px; padding-left: 15px; list-style-type: disc;">

    <details>
      <summary>Will tuning void my warranty?</summary>
      <p style="margin-left: 0px; padding-left: 15px; list-style-type: disc;">
        While we cannot guarantee the status of your warranty, it's noteworthy that we have yet to encounter any warranty issues 
        reported by our customers. Should you have any concerns post-tuning, we provide a complimentary service to revert your 
        vehicle to its original, stock configuration. We take pride in noting that this service has never been needed for any engine 
        or transmission-related warranty issues. <br><br>

        It's essential to understand that with any aftermarket modification, there's a possibility that if the modification is 
        identified as the direct cause of a fault, it could potentially affect your warranty. However, the presence of a tune on 
        your vehicle, in itself, does not automatically invalidate your warranty.

    <details>
      <summary>Is it possible to restore my vehicle to its original factory settings?</summary>

        Absolutely! Your vehicle can be restored to its original, factory settings whenever desired.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>Is the tune detectable by the dealership?</summary>
      <p style="margin-left: 0px; padding-left: 15px; list-style-type: disc;">
        Our tuning software does not alter the OEM identification that appears during scans. This ensures that, when assessed 
        using standard Toyota calibration tools, it reflects the original "stock" calibration settings.</p>
